Virga v2 includes the ability to do aggregates. This requires a different database of optical properties if you are interested in those. Otherwise you are sitll okay to use the spherical particle only database. For climate modeling (paired with picaso) spherical particle database is recommended. 

- Spherical: `Download and read about these <https://zenodo.org/records/15886530>`_ for spherical particles (either v1 or v2). 

- Aggregates: `Download and read about these <https://zenodo.org/records/16581692>`_ for aggregate particles (only for v2).
