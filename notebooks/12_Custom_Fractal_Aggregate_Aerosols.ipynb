    "The VIRGA v2.0 aerosol database makes the assumption that $N_{mon}$=1000 for all species. To explore other options, you need to calculate your own .mieff grids by calculating $Q_{ext}$, $Q_{sca}$ and the asymmetry parameter $g$ for each wavelength, particle size, shape and condensible species that forms in the clouds. We do this using Modified Mean Field theory, which is built into the code optool : https://github.com/cdominik/optool . For more details on MMF calculations in general, see the following papers:\n",

    "Below we create files for 5 different fractal dimensions: Df = [1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 2.8] and $N_{mon}$ = 2,000. To guide you through the creation of the .mieff grid, VIRGA will print each sub-bin that it is currently calculating optical properties for, as well as the exact aggregate properties in each sub-bin. It does calculations for 6 sub-bins, finds the average, and then moves onto the next radius bin (separated by dashed lines). The calculation order is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick a sub-bin radius, beginning with the smallest particles.\n",
    "    - Calculate optical properties for all wavelengths at this radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Tip:</b> If optool is compiled with the \"make multi=True\" command, it will calculate properties for multiple wavelengths on different cores, giving a signficant speed boost (especially if combined with HPC architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to calculate optical properties for fixed $r_{mon}$ instead of $N_{mon}$, a second example codeblock is commented out below (see Figure 2 and discussion in Moran & Lodge (2025) for details on both methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may notice that you set $N_{mon}$ = 2,000 but for the smallest particle in the grid, the N_mon value printed is much smaller. This is because $r_{mon}$ is not allowed to be smaller than an atom, but VIRGA may still require small particles, so the smallest particles in the grid are allowed to deviate from the fixed N_mon value to remain physical. See Figure 2 and discussion in Moran & Lodge (2025) for more details on this. In each sub-bin, the values of $N_{mon}$, $R_{gyr}$, $k_{0}$ and $r_{mon}$ are printed for clarity on the exact parameters that MMF is using to calculate optical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your calculations are taking a long time, check the guidance on reducing calculation time for spheres above. However, note that MMF calculations for large numbers of radii and wavelengths can just take a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, check your wavelength ranges in the .refrind files. If the wavelength range spans > 3 orders of magnitude, due to computational memory issues multithreading may be disabled and calculations can be limited to one core at a time, which can slow things down (a warning will be printed if this happens). Avoid this by only submitting wavelengths that you NEED in your .refrind file (and subsequent optool .lnk file)."
