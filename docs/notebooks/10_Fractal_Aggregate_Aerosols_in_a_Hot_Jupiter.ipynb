    "# Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in a Hot Jupiter atmosphere\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to run virga for non-spherical cloud particles. \n",
    "2. How to compare the particle sizes and optical properties for aggregates vs. spheres\n",
    "\n",
    "Aerosols can come in a variety of shapes and sizes, which we typically characterise by their fractal dimension (Df). Under this framework, aerosols are made of collections of small spheres called monomers, and Df=3 would represent the most compact possible arrangement, whereas Df=1 would be something perfectly linear. Real aerosols are usually somewhere in-between 1 and 3, and the ultimate shape of an aerosol is usually a result of their formation conditions. VIRGA v2.0 allows us to silmultaneously model the effects of a range of different particle shapes on spectra so we can find the best fit to observational data. For further details and example of typical shapes, see Lodge & Moran et al. (2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "Striving to maintain the simplicity and ethod of virga, aerosols can be added by providing two simple parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) The fractal dimension (general shape) of the aerosols (which can be an array).\n",
    "    b) EITHER the number of monomers (N_mon) OR the radius of the monomer (r_mon).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 of Moran & Lodge et al. (2025) demonstrates both of the choices for (b) and explains them in detail -- see this for more guidance. in this tutorial we will choose an array of fractal dimensions, and we choose to fix the number of monomers ($N_{mon}$=1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, make sure you have downloaded the new optical database for aggregates from here: https://zenodo.org/records/16581692 (which are all calculated with the assumption that $N_{mon}$=1000) and update the filepaths to the VIRGA reference data in the first cell:"

Therefore, the aggregates need to form into more massive particles to stay stable against the same upwards velocity from Kzz/convection).
