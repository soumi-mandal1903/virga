    "# Fractal Aggregate Spectra in PICASO\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to run virga for non-spherical cloud particles. \n",
    "2. How to generate and compare spectra for fractal aggregates vs. spheres in PICASO\n",
    "3. How to compare the particle sizes and optical properties for aggregates vs. spheres\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> This tutorial builds directly on the methods in tutorial \"Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in a Hot Jupiter\", using the same planet and conditions as an example. However in this tutorial, the atmosphere is set-up within PICASO and virga is called using PICASO's built-in function. The varied spectra from each choice of particle shape are then compared. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Aerosols can come in a variety of shapes and sizes, which we typically characterise by their fractal dimension (Df). Under this framework, aerosols are made of collections of small spheres called monomers, and Df=3 would represent the most compact possible arrangement, whereas Df=1 would be something perfectly linear. Real aerosols are usually somewhere in-between 1 and 3, and the ultimate shape of an aerosol is usually a result of their formation conditions. VIRGA v2.0 allows us to silmultaneously model the effects of a range of different particle shapes on spectra so we can find the best fit to observational data. For further details and example of typical shapes, see Lodge & Moran et al. (2025).\n",
    "\n",
    "Striving to maintain the simplicity and ethod of virga, aerosols can be added by providing two simple parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) The fractal dimension (general shape) of the aerosols (which can be an array).\n",
    "    b) EITHER the number of monomers (N_mon) OR the radius of the monomer (r_mon).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 of Moran & Lodge et al. (2025) demonstrates both of the choices for (b) and explains them in detail -- see this for more guidance. in this tutorial we will choose an array of fractal dimensions, and we choose to fix the number of monomers ($N_{mon}$=1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning, make sure you have downloaded the new optical database for aggregates from here: https://zenodo.org/records/16581692 (which are all calculated with the assumption that $N_{mon}$=1000) and update the filepaths to the VIRGA/PICASO reference data in the first cell:"

    "<b>Interpretation:</b> This is usually a busy plot, but gives some intuition into how linear and compact aggregates compare to their spherical counterparts. Here the linear fractals with Df = 1.2 are the most opaque at short wavelengths. We saw that these particles are the least opaque in the transmission spectrum, which is because their number density is so much lower as shown in the previous figure.\n",

    "- The red outline box marks the extremes of the .mieff grid, with faint red vertical lines representing the grid spacing in radius.\n",
    "- The vertical extent of the box is just to show the wavelength range in the .mieff files. The colored markers show the column density so that we have an indication of how many particles were in each radius bin for each model.\n",
    "- The \"radius\" of an aggregate is defined as the compact radius (the radius of a sphere made from the same volume of material) and this is how they are stored in the .mieff files. The particle sizes obtained by virga at each pressure layer and for each fractal dimension are plotted on this grid as markers, and these should all ideally be inside the horizontal bounds of the red box. If not, you may need to adjust your Kzz/fsed values (both of these can effect particle size), or make a new .mieff grid (see next tutorial!). It's ok for the particles to be near the vertical bounds of the red box -- the marker y-positions just scale with column density, so they will always sit on the top/bottom edge of the box."
