There are two separate zenodo postings for spheres, and for aggregates. If you are not interested in aggregates, download the spherical indecies only.

- Spherical: `Download and read about these https://zenodo.org/records/15886530`_ for spherical particles (either v1 or v2). 

- Aggregates: `Download and read about these https://zenodo.org/records/16581692`_ for aggregate particles (only for v2).



No need to add an environment variable. We will just ask for the path to where they are located.
